#TODO

- Turn robot_config in ROS2 params
- Develop ServoBridge
    - Need to factor in that some Servos angles will be inverse because the servo itself is moving the joint not the arm

- Develop visualization
    - Remove variables and build into URDF XACRO (i.e., remove hip_front_x, etc)
    - Change Xacro args to properties
